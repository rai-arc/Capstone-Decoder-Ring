# Capstone-Decoder-Ring
## Summary
* Built to be an encryption/decryption application to communicate and read top-secret messages.
* Created utilizing the test-driven development method.
Technology: JavaScript ES6, HTML5, Node.js, Bootstrap, Mocha, Chai.

## Details
This project was primarily created to demonstrate my understanding of JavaScript functions per Thinkful cirriculum.
The intention of this application is for the user to encode or decode messages using a Caesar Shift, Polybius Square, or Subtitution Cipher.
It gives instant feedback on submission to show a decoded message or an encoded message, ready to be copy and pasted.
There are no planned updates for this project.
